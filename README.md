C is a general-purpose programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is a low-level language, which means that it allows for direct manipulation of computer memory and hardware resources. C is also known for its efficiency, flexibility, and portability, making it a popular choice for developing operating systems, compilers, and other system software.

C has influenced many other programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python, and it is still widely used today. C is also often used for embedded systems and other applications that require low-level programming. It has a relatively simple syntax and offers powerful constructs, such as pointers, that enable developers to write efficient and complex programs. However, because it is a low-level language, C requires more attention to detail than higher-level languages, and it can be more challenging to learn for beginners.
